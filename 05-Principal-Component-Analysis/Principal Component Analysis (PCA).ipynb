    "# **Principal Component Analysis Lab**\n",
    "#### This lab delves into exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation. We will use a dataset of light-sheet imaging recorded by the [Ahrens Lab](http://www.janelia.org/lab/ahrens-lab) at Janelia Research Campus, and hosted on the CodeNeuro [data repository](http://datasets.codeneuro.org).\n",
    "#### Our dataset is generated by studying the movement of a larval [zebrafish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish), an animal that is especially useful in neuroscience because it is transparent, making it possible to record activity over its entire brain using a technique called [light-sheet microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_s

    "# **Principal Component Analysis Lab**\n",
    "#### This lab delves into exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation. We will use a dataset of light-sheet imaging recorded by the [Ahrens Lab](http://www.janelia.org/lab/ahrens-lab) at Janelia Research Campus, and hosted on the CodeNeuro [data repository](http://datasets.codeneuro.org).\n",
    "#### Our dataset is generated by studying the movement of a larval [zebrafish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrafish), an animal that is especially useful in neuroscience because it is transparent, making it possible to record activity over its entire brain using a technique called [light-sheet microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_sheet_fluorescence_microscopy).   Specifically, we'll work with time-varying images containing patterns of the zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern.   Different stimuli induce different patterns across the brain, and we can use exploratory analyses to identify these patterns.  Read [\"Mapping brain activity at scale with cluster computing\"](http://thefreemanlab.com/work/papers/freeman-2014-nature-methods.pdf) for more information about these kinds of analyses.\n",
    "#### During this lab you will learn about PCA, and then compare and contrast different exploratory analyses of the same data set to identify which neural patterns they best highlight.\n",
